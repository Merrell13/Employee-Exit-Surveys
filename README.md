# Employee-Exit-Surveys
Using Python's Pandas module to analyze employee exit surveys

In this project I will work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

The goal of this project is to answer the following questions:

Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
To do this I will follow three steps:

Explore the data to see what cleaning needs to be done.
